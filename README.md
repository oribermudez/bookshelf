# MyReads Project

This is a bookshelf app where you can have a control over the books you are currently reading, the ones you want to read and the ones you already read. You also have a book search feature to add more books to your bookshelves. It is entirely made with React JS.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

Enjoy!
